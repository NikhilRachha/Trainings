1.the ngIf directive is a structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the value of
an expression coerced to Boolean. When the expression evaluates to true, Angular renders the template 
provided in a then clause, and when false or null, Angular renders the template provided in an optional
else clause.
Example:
<div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>

2.We can serve an image in angular2 by first placing the image in the assets directory of your project where
you can create a specific directory for the images or just keep it in the assets directory as it is.Once you
 have put all the required images in the assets directory open the specific component typescript (.ts) file 
where you want to serve the image. Now you can add the URL of the image in a variable within the constructor
so that it is initialized upon component creation.
