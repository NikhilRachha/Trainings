Ans. The Object class is the base class for all the classes in the .Net Framework. It is present 
in the System namespace. Every class in C# is directly or indirectly derived from the Object
class. If a class does not extend any other class then it is the direct child class of the Object
class and if extends another class then it is indirectly derived. Therefore the Object class 
methods are available to all C# classes. Hence Object class acts as a root of the inheritance 
hierarchy in any C# Program. The main purpose of the Object class is to provide low-level services
to derived classes.
